In this blog post, I will be reviewing the infamous instapoetry book “milk and honey” by Rupi Kaur, as well as explaining why instapoetry/modern poetry is a complete and utter mess. 

“milk and honey” is a collection of poetry and prose that discusses topics such as love, loss, abuse, and femininity. The book is divided into four sections: The Hurting, The Loving, The Breaking, and The Healing. The book also contains illustrations that accompany most of the poems. 

This book has received so much hype from the booktube community in particular and at first, I thought it became popular because of the criticism it has received. I was surprised, however, to find that many people were supporting this book and recommending it to others, so I decided to pick it up to see what all the fuss is about. 

Before I jump into this review, I just want to touch on a controversial topic regarding this book: is it poetry or not? Besides reading this specific “instapoetry” book, the only other poetry book I have fully read is “The Princess Saves Herself In This One” by Amanda Lovelace, so I don’t have much experience with poetry. Nonetheless, whatever this book was, I find it really difficult to classify it as poetry, because to me, it seems more like abusing the enter and tab buttons on the keyboard. But what do I know? Some people classify this as poetry, some don’t. But anyways, due to my lack of experience with poetry, I’m not going to dive into a lot of depth in this argument. 

Although my general thoughts on this book are negative, I just want to say that if this book is what introduces people to poetry and encourages them to read more of that genre, or if it makes poetry seem less intimidating and a lot more accessible and easily understandable by more people, then that is absolutely wonderful. It’s nice to see a lot more young readers taking interest in poetry, perhaps because of this book, and for that I think Rupi Kaur deserves at least a little bit of credit. 

However, what disappointed me about this book is that it seemed to me as more of a collection of tumblr quotes and the poems themselves lack any deeper meaning. Yes, they are easy to understand and that may be why so many people are attracted to them, but not once while I was reading this book did I find the need to stop and think a little bit about the deeper metaphors or hidden meanings in the poems themselves. I found it really hard to analyze the poems because there was nothing more to them. 

For example:

<pre class="highlighter-rouge">
<i>stay</i>
i whispered
as you
shut the door behind you
</pre>

Do you see what I mean?
Also, although I shouldn’t be commenting much on the structure of the poems (being a ‘poetry amateur’ myself), I find it a bit irritating how the words are isolated on separate lines, because that feature doesn’t add any extra meaning to the poem. Some of the poems would’ve made the same exact impact if they were written as a single sentence. I think the author just randomly isolated some of the words to make this classify as a ‘poem’. 

Some of the poems also make absolutely no sense, such as:

<pre class="highlighter-rouge">
how do you turn
a forest fire like me
so soft i turn into
running water
</pre>

The whole concept of fire turning into water makes no sense because they are completely different elements. Also, the metaphor of a person being a ‘forest fire’ is so cliché as well, just like many of the metaphors used in this book. 

For example:

<pre class="highlighter-rouge">
you were temptingly beautiful
but stung when i got close
</pre>

The first thing I thought of when I read this was the quote from Shakespeare’s Macbeth: “look like the innocent flower but be the serpent under't”. I just feel like this metaphor of appearance versus reality has been done so many times, and the metaphor used in this poem isn’t unique, original, or in any way a new take on this idea. 
What frustrates me about this book is that the topics it dealt with allowed for such powerful poems but they were just so underwhelming it’s ridiculous. 

And as for this poem:

<pre class="highlighter-rouge">
removing all the hair
off your body is okay
if that’s what you want to do
just as much as keeping all the hair
on your body is okay
if that’s what you want to do

<i>-you belong only to yourself</i>
</pre>

I understand the message she’s trying to put across, but this poem is so ridiculous I don’t understand how it even qualifies as a poem in the first place.This sounds like a text message, not a poem!

I think the thing that upsets me the most is that although this book may introduce people to poetry and spark an interest in poetry again, this is the type of poetry young people are reading and praising when I’m sure there are so many better poets out there that write actually meaningful poems. I don’t understand why this book received so much popularity. 

And as much as I don’t like tearing apart somebody’s work that they probably spent a lot of time on, when any form of art is published to the public, it is expected to receive at least a little bit of criticism. But what really pushed me over the edge with this book was this poem near the end:

<pre class="highlighter-rouge">
your art
is not about how many people
like your art
your art
is about
if your heart likes your work
if your soul likes your work
it’s about how honest 
you are with yourself

and you 
must never
trade honesty
for relatability

<i>-advice to young writers</i>
</pre>

This may be inspirational and encouraging to the young writers that this is dedicated to, but when I first read it, the way it came across to me was that she was almost putting up a shield against any criticism her book might receive by calling it ‘art’ and saying it doesn’t matter how many people like it because, well, it’s art. 

Overall, I personally think that this book has dealt with many heavy topics that voice the concerns of people who experienced them, and it may seem very empowering and feminist. However, what made me rate it only two stars is how shallow and meaningless the poems are, and how this book had so much potential to deal with these topics but approached them in such a basic and superficial level.
