<b>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.</b>

It’s about time I finally read The Sun is Also a Star! This book has been talked about in the booktube community for what feels like forever and I recently picked up a copy. I had high expectations because I loved ‘Everything, Everything’, but by the time I reached the last page, I felt very conflicted. In this review, I’ll be discussing ‘The Sun is Also a Star’ by Nicola Yoon and explaining my contrasting opinions on this book. 

‘The Sun is Also a Star’ follows the story of Natasha Kingsley, a Jamaican-born pragmatist, idealist character who doesn’t believe in fate, true love, or destiny. She is fighting her family’s deportation on what appears to be her last day in the US. Over the course of this day, Natasha meets Daniel Bae, a character who is the polar opposite of her. Daniel believes in true love and fate, but always has to live up to his Korean parents’ expectations of becoming a doctor, even when he doesn’t want to be. As the story unfolds, these two teenagers fall in love with each other during this magical day in New York City. 

Before we get to the good bits, let’s start with what bothered me about this book. Firstly, this book is built on a series of unbelievable coincidences that are convenient for the plot. This did appear to be convenient at some points to Daniel who was trying to convince Natasha that everything that happened that day that led them to be together wasn’t simply a coincidence, but fate. But there are some parts when the coincidences were not relevant to Daniel proving his point, such as the ending. What are the odds that ten years after the story takes place, Daniel and Natasha end up on the same plane only one row apart? And that they end up noticing each other because of Irene—the guard at the USCIS building Natasha went to at the beginning of the book for an appointment regarding her family’s deportation—who thanked Natasha for saving her life? Yes, the story does come full circle at the end, and it is a much more satisfying ending than Natasha simply getting deported and never seeing Daniel again, but that particular event is such a coincidence that it’s hard to believe that it would even happen.

Another thing is that this book features a lot of insta-love. I mean, to be fair, when a story has to unfold over the course of a day, it is pretty expected. Now, Natasha didn’t really instantly fall in love with Daniel, but he did. Right after they talk, Daniel thinks to himself:

<pre class="highlighter-rouge">
Who meets a cute girl and shakes her hand?
Charlie would’ve said something charming to her. They’d be having a cozy coffee someplace dark and romantic. She’d already be dreaming of little half-Korean, half-African American babies.
</pre>

He literally started thinking of “their babies” right after meeting her! That’s like insta-love to the next level! 

Also, the two characters’ contrasting personalities do appear to compliment each other once they met, but at the beginning of the story, they seemed to be almost like caricatures of the stereotypes they represented. For example, in this excerpt:

<pre class="highlighter-rouge">
“This isn’t destiny. I chose this career. It didn’t choose me. I’m not fated to be a data scientist. There’s a career section in the library at school. I did research on growing fields in the sciences, and ta-da. No fate or destiny involved, just research.” 
“So it’s not something you’re passionate about?” 
She shrugs and starts walking again. 
“It suits my personality,” she says. 
“Don’t you want to do something you love?” 
“Why?” she asks, like she genuinely doesn’t understand the appeal of loving something.
</pre>

It’s clear from the start of the book that Natasha is a pragmatic character. However, her qualities are exaggerated so much that it makes her seem more like a robot than an actual human. She is okay with believing that life has no meaning, and is totally okay with working at a job that she isn’t passionate about, as long as it’s practical. These may all be qualities of a typical pragmatic person, but she appears to “genuinely (not) understand the appeal of loving something” when on page 139, she literally says: “I love that song,” after singing “Fell on Black Days” in the karaoke room. My point is, she seems very apathetic at the beginning of the book. Despite loving certain things such as grunge music, she shows no feelings at all about anything else, and this makes her seem ‘less human’ in a way.

After reading this book, I watched <i>The English Teacher</i>’s review, and there was one part where he was reading a sentence that Natasha had thought to herself after she and Daniel met (as she’s staring at his hair), and his reaction was so perfect I just had to include it:

<pre class="highlighter-rouge">
“It’s just hair, I tell myself. Its function is to keep the head warm and protect it against ultraviolet radiation. There’s nothing inherently sexy about it.”
</pre>

<i>The English Teacher</i>'s reaction: "Jesus Christ, Spock! Calm down!”

But anyways, enough of that.
Let’s move on to why this book is pretty great!

Despite some of the cringy bits, I could not put this book down. I personally love when chapters are quite short, because I could tell myself “Oh just three more pages and I’ll stop reading” but then end up finishing five more chapters.

Also, after Daniel and Natasha started to affect each others’ ideologies and grew more connected, I became so invested in their story. As I mentioned earlier, their contrasting personalities really compliment each other as the story develops, and their character development (especially Natasha’s) made me love them even more. 

The suspense that was building up throughout the book as Natasha keeps fighting her family’s deportation peaked nearly two hundred pages in, and I loved it. At the beginning of the book, I immediately thought she wouldn’t get deported because there has to be a happy ending, right? But the possibility of her getting deported not only surprised me and made the book less predictable, but also allowed me to cherish every moment between her and Daniel because they might never see each other again.

This book also included an interesting feature of having several chapters that discuss topics mentioned in previous chapters. For example, there is an entire chapter on dark matter, and another on the chemistry behind love. It’s a unique idea that made this book stand out to me as I’ve never seen that done before. This book also included chapters dedicated to very minor characters to tell their story. Even when the characters seemed so irrelevant and minor, their stories massively affected the events that occurred in this story. 

An example of this is that before Daniel meets Natasha, his train conductor begins giving a speech about christianity and finding God to try and evangelize the passengers of the train. After leaving the train, Daniel starts to look for a sign that God is real, and notices <i>DEUS EX MACHINA</i> printed in large white letters on the back of Natasha’s jacket. It translates to “God from the machine”. It is revealed in the following chapter that the conductor did this because of a divorce. The point is, the conductor’s story basically led to Daniel and Natasha meeting, creating a butterfly effect that influenced the rest of the story's events.

Besides the train conductor, I think the minor character who affected me the most throughout this story is Irene, the security guard. She decided very early on in the book that she was going to commit suicide, and I found myself thinking about what had happened to her as I reached the end of the book. I cannot even begin to explain the relief I felt when I discovered that she was still alive because of Natasha’s thank-you message. Most of all, I liked how Irene was the first and last minor character to be mentioned in the book, so there’s almost this cyclical structure that links the story really well.

I also absolutely loved the way one of the chapters about Natasha’s dad was written. He is an actor, so the entire chapter is written as a play script. I thought it was really interesting because I have never seen a play format being used in the middle of a novel.

So yeah! Minor characters are awesome!

Overall, I thought I had pretty neutral feelings about this book, but after writing this review, I think I might be leaning a little more towards liking it. I don’t think it’s the best book I’ve ever read, but I did like it a bit more than I disliked it. I enjoyed the unique formatting of the book, and how gripping the story was. I also loved the characters, especially Daniel. Of course, the book did feature insta-love which I’m not a fan of, and the book was based around a series of unbelievably lucky coincidences. Oh, and Natasha’s early characterization was a bit iffy. But at the end of the day, it still was quite an enjoyable story, and I rated it a solid three stars!
